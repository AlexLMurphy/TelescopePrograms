# College of the Holy Cross: Cosmic Ray Telescope Programs for Research

I have decided to make these programs open-source because I hope they may be useful to others; it is possible that others could be interested in this research.

These programs are not under active development; I am no longer conducting this research at the College of the Holy Cross. However, I think others will continue to expand upon this research in following years. Therefore, please address any concerns related to this research or its programs to our faculty advisor for this research, Prof. Tomohiko Narita tnarita@holycross.edu

# AnalyzeCRData Gui.py
This program serves several data anlysis purposes. Most importantly, it is used for processing the hexadecimal output from telescope recordings. Data collection with the cosmic ray telescopes is time-sensitive because detector dead-time affects our results, so it is better to process the data afterwards. This program serves as a combination of programs in many ways. See documentation for more details.

# TargetFrequency.py
A specialized and not user-friendly program. This program is used by modifying constants in the source code. I made this to iteratively calculate ideal bin sizes for analyzing a target frequency in a FFT.
